I find error handling in Go to require extra consideration. The guidance given
to me was: a) error comes from 3rd-pary library? errors.Wrap it to give it a
stack trace and context. b) error comes from somewhere else in my code?
errors.WithMessage it to give it context. In some cases just passing the
original error up the call stack is the right thing. I haven't considered the
error handling in this PR to the extent of where we should be doing what, but I
highlighted several places we may want to take another look.  The go app to
preprocess new locations in the safe coordinates review queue gets compiled to
the name safe-coordinates-review-queue which may be confusing to someone who
doesn't know what it needs to do to the review queue. I'd suggest adding
"preprocessor" or something else to the title to help indicate what the program
does.
